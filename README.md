# USACOVID19Tracker

This will be a CLI based display for keeping track of daily COVID-19 statistics in the United States. I am building it to strengthen my Ruby skills as part of the CodeLabs Ruby on Rails curriculum.

Part one is finished (3/1/22), part 2 to be completed soon.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'USA_COVID_19_Tracker'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install USA_COVID_19_Tracker

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing
